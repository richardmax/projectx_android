<h1>YOUR Upp&trade; HAS SHUT DOWN UNEXPECTEDLY</h1>
<p>Upp will automatically shut down if it detects your device is fully charged.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will protect the internal battery of your device and extend its life.</p>
<p>Upp will shutdown if it detects poor airflow.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fuel cell requires a sufficient flow of oxygen to properly operate.</p>
<p>Upp will shut down when it detects a low fuel level in the cartridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please restart Upp and check the LED indicator light.
